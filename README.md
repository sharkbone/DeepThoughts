# DeepThoughts
A web page to collect deep and inspirational thoughts.

This project is a way for me to practice web development. The page will start out as something fairly simple, to locally collect, store and display thoughts from the user. The plan is to, eventually, make it into something that can be used by multiple people and have thoughts display from those different users to the others.
